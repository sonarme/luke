![Luke, the Lucene Toolbox Project](https://github.com/DmitryKey/luke/src/main/resources/img/luke.gif "Luke")

This is mavenised version of Luke tool maintained and further developed by Dmitry Kan (this repo owner).

* The original author is Andrzej Bialecki (https://code.google.com/p/luke)
* The project has been mavenized by Neil Ireson (see google group discussion here: http://bit.ly/16Y8utO)
* The project has been ported to Lucene trunk (marked as 5.0 at the time) by Dmitry Kan
* The project has been back-ported to Lucene 4.3 by sonarname, who later decided not to continue supporting the project
* There are updates to the (non-mavenized) project done by tarzanek (https://github.com/tarzanek/luke)

This project's goal is:

0. Keep the project mavenized (compatible with Apache Lucene and Solr style)
1. To port the thinlet UI to an ASL compliant license framework so that it can be contributed back to Apache Lucene.
   Current work is done with GWT 2.5.1.
2. To revive the project and establish a single point of trust for the development and updates of the tool. This said,
   everyone is welcome to join.


There are other more technical goals, that will get updated here as they get into the shape.
